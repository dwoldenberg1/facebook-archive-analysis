# facebook-archive-analysis
My goal in designing this Facebook data analysis was to understand the user through their messages. I created a javascript script that renders out various metrics and data to your browser window. I wanted to prove how easy it is for Facebook to profile their users based on only even one of the many datasets available to them. I use message data to track whether the user is likely a programmer or not (and what types of files they share with others), when the user is active (day or night person), and generally whether the person is happy based on usage of certain keywords in their conversation (sentiment analysis).
